# Javascript Code Quiz

### This is a  Javascript quiz I made from scratch using html, css, and javascript. The rules are as follows....

* Game Rules
  * You get 120 seconds to answer as many questions as you can.
  * If you answer incorrectly the background will turn red and you will lose 20 seconds off of the timer.
  * If answered correctly the background will change to green and you get 10 points!
  * Hit "next" button for next question.
  * At end of quiz, submit your score to the high scores!

#### Each question is chosen randomly so they occur in a different order every time the start button is click. Once submitted the scores are saved into local storage therefore they will show up on the high score page every time it is loaded, unless you clear the scores.
